####  Challange 1

Challenge #1
Setup a basic web page with an input field and an output field. The first input field takes a number and the second field shows the corresponding output based on a calculation specified below.
Calculation: The input is multiplied by itself minus 1 until it reaches 1.

For example if the input is 4 then the output should return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 24
For the test cases the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will always be an integer.
Sample test cases: Input: 4
Output: 24
Input: 8 Output: 40320

I would like to see these input- and output elements centered on the page/screen (make it look a bit nice).



#### Challange 2 

Add to the basic web page from challenge #1 an input field. This input field takes again a number after which I would like you to write a script that outputs to the console the following:
Iterate/loop from 1 to the number specified in the input field. When the iteration is a multiple of 3 please log ‘SKIM’, when the iteration is a multiple of 5 please log “is a great place to work!!” and when the iteration is a multiple of 3 AND 5 please log “SKIM is a great place to work!!”. If none of the above, please log the number to the console.
Sample test case:

Input: 15
Output:
1, 2, “SKIM”, 4, “is a great place to work!!”, “SKIM”, 7, 8, “SKIM”, “is a great place to work!!”, 11, “SKIM”, 13, 14, “SKIM is a great place to work!!”

#### Challange 3

Challenge #3 (bonus)
It would be nice to have both challenges next to each other on the webpage with some kind of separation. When the screen width changes they should be underneath one another (responsive design).
